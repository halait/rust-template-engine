# YARTL (Template) Engine
This is the template engine of YARTL (Yet Another Rusty Template Language). I am developing a template language and engine to learn about Rust, WASM, compilers and interpreters. YARTL engine can be compiled to WASM and run on the web. `docs` directory contains a WASM build and JavaScript binding.
