# YARTL (Template) Engine
This is the template engine of YARTL (Yet Another Rusty Template Language). I am developing a template language and engine to learn about Rust, WASM, compilers and interpreters. YARTL can be compiled to WASM and run the web. `docs` directory contains a WASM build along with JavaScript binding.
