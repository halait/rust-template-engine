# YARTL (Template) Engine
This is the template engine of YARTL (Yet Another Rusty Template Language). I am developing a template language and engine to learn about Rust, WASM, compilers and interpreters. YARTL engine can be compiled to WASM and run on the web. `docs` directory contains a WASM build and JavaScript binding. See the [test document](https://halait.github.io/yartl-engine/) that I am using for an example, it is rendered on the client-side using [test.html](https://halait.github.io/yartl-engine/test.html) and [test.json](https://halait.github.io/yartl-engine/test.json).
